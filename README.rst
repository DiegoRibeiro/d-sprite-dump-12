Tibia sprite dump version 12+
========================

Python 3 project to uncompress tibia assets from client version 12, could work on other versions.

How to run:
########
1. clone the project
2. open a terminal inside the folder d_sprite_dump_1200
3. python .\\main.py 'C:\\path\\to\\assets' (e.g. D:\Tibia\packages\Tibia\assets)
4. the assets will be created inside the output folder

note: for linux you have to fix the \\\\ to / inside the script catalog_util.py/main.py, i haven't test this on a linux distro. This will be improved over time.
